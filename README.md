# BraiseEngine
A game engine based on Monogame, made to be a middle ground between the freedom of a framework, and the abstraction of a game engine.

# Usage
-Download the latest release (or build the repo yourself)  
-Create a new Monogame Project.  
-Install Newtonsoft.Json from NuGet  
-Import the built DLL  
-Change the inherited class of Game1 to Core and import BraiseEngine  
-add the line `Core.Instance = game;` right before `game.Run();` in Program.cs  
(optional): change the Game1 class to only include the base functions.
